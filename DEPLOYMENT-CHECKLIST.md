## ‚ö†Ô∏è Required Database Migration

### IMPORTANT: Run Database Script in Supabase

**You must run the following SQL script in Supabase SQL Editor to enable the new features:**

```
File: add-visit-discussed-products.sql
```

#### How to Run:

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
4. Click **New Query**
5. Copy the entire contents of `add-visit-discussed-products.sql`
6. Paste into the SQL Editor
7. Click **Run** (or press Cmd/Ctrl + Enter)
8. Verify success message

#### What This Script Does:

‚úÖ Creates `visit_discussed_products` table
‚úÖ Adds indexes for performance
‚úÖ Enables Row Level Security (RLS)
‚úÖ Creates RLS policies for all user roles:
   - Super admins can view all
   - Managers can view their team's data
   - Representatives can view, insert, and delete their own
‚úÖ Creates `visit_discussed_products_detailed` view for reporting
‚úÖ Grants necessary permissions

## üîß Troubleshooting

### If discussed products don't load:
1. Check that `add-visit-discussed-products.sql` was run successfully
2. Verify RLS policies are enabled: `SELECT * FROM visit_discussed_products LIMIT 1;`
3. Check browser console for specific errors

### If representatives can't see products:
1. Verify representative has assigned brands in `representative_brands` table
2. Check that brands have products in `products` table
3. Verify RLS policy allows representative to read their brands

### If managers/admins can't access visit history:
1. Check user role is correct in `users` table
2. Verify manager has `manager_id` set correctly in `managers` table
3. Check browser console for auth errors
